# Audit Evaluation and Future Prediction Modeling

Analyzing real data. Using machine learning.

This project seeks to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to assess the likelihood of audits in policy data, specifically Workerâ€™s Compensation and potentially General Liability commercial policies. The objective is to determine which policies may be audited in the upcoming calendar year based on historical data and model predictions.
